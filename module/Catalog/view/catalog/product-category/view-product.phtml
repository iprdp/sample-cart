        Use only in a safe environment. The Gear VR produces a distracting, immersive virtual reality experience that blocks your view of your actual surroundings. Read and follow warnings and instructions included with the Headset before use.
        The Headset should be calibrated before each use. Not for use by children under 13. A virtual reality experience may trigger health reactions. See a doctor before use if you have a history of seizures. Stop use if you experience a health reaction.
        Always be aware of your surroundings when using the Gear VR. Remain seated or stationary at all times.
        Take special care to ensure that you are not near other people, objects, stairs, balconies, windows, furniture, or other items that you can bump into or knock down when using — or immediately after using — the Gear VR headset.
        Do not handle sharp or otherwise dangerous objects while using the Gear VR. Never wear the Gear VR in situations that require attention, such as walking, bicycling, or driving.
        Some apps and services such as Netflix require payment or subscriptions to use. Charges may apply.
